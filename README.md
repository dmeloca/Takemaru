# Takemaru
- This code is an "approximation" of a stenographer based on the python programming language, it has a cesar-mode cipher, and a tool to hide (and extract) messages in an image.
- At the moment the project is paused, however, if you want to make any comment, change or suggestion, don't be shy...

## Getting Started
- In making the project, I decided to keep it as simple as possible.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- PILLOW library
- OS library
- SYS library
- TIME library

### Installation
- The installation is very simple, you just need to be sure all libraries are installed and download the version of TAKEMURA you need.
- The PILLOW library could be isntalled as follows:
<pre>pip install Pillow</pre>

## Usage
- It is simple, you need to select the number of the tool you want to use.
- If you want to insert an image, please be careful, put the whole route when it request to you.


## Contributing

- If you find any bugs or changes you want to make, make a pull request (I will try to keep an eye on it), this is a learning project and I would expect your help.

## License
- As we like it is open source
